# Overview of pyshotgrid's default entities

We ship a set of default entities that extend the functionality of some common entity types in
Flow Production Tracking. Their implementation is rely on pyshotgrid's plugin system that you are free to use
, too. ([Here is a guide](https://fabiangeisler.github.io/pyshotgrid/how_to_add_custom_entities.html)
to implement additional functionality to any FPTR entity.) This page
will give you a brief overview of the extra functionality and their connections between each other.

:::{note}
Each of the default entities inherit from SGEntity!
